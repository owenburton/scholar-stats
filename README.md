## TODO:

<!-- - switch from doing bs4 scraping on cloud run to the dashboard on app engine -->

- write tests for everything
- make more OOP (Classes)
- more descriptive iterator var names
- for loop for try/catch blocks
- polish code
- ask for code reviews

## MAYBE:
- get user ip & headers to use w/ selenium, so Cloud Run server doesn't get blocked

- maybe year slider

- change favicon & website title (currently unsupported by streamlit)
- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/1006

- add author picture
- have them just type in a name, then choose one from dropdown
