## TODO:

# group any auth positions above 5 as "over 5th"

## MAYBE:

# extract publication dates using bs4 (account for dates in pub title)
# add in a slider to sort by year

# database to store name/url pairs
# insert a gif of how it works
# add author picture
# have them just type in a name, then choose one from dropdown
# summarize most impactful work (T5 summarization)
# add a cache of scholar data for fast lookups
