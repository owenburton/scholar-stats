## TODO:

<!-- - switch from doing bs4 scraping on cloud run to the dashboard on app engine -->
- write tests for everything
- make more OOP (Classes)
- more descriptive iterator var names
- for loop for try/catch blocks
- write note about the app's accuracy in identifying author positions
- polish code
- ask for code reviews

## MAYBE:

- change favicon & website title (currently unsupported by streamlit)
- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/1006

- extract publication dates using bs4 (account for dates in pub title)
- add in a slider to sort by year

- database to store name/url pairs
- add author picture
- have them just type in a name, then choose one from dropdown
- summarize most impactful work (T5 summarization)
- add a cache of scholar data for fast lookups
